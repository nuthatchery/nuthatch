This project contains the relevant syntax definitions for the
'java-front' parser originally developed for Stratego.

The syntax definitions are from java-front 0.9.1. The original
code can be found in the 'original' branch in Git.

You need the StrategoXT tool chain installed in order to compile
the syntax definitions into a parse table. This is only necessary
if you actually change the definitions, since a compiled parse table
is included here.
