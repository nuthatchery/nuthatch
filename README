This project contains the relevant syntax definitions for the
JavaFront parser originally developed for Stratego.

JavaFront adds support for Java program transformation to Nuthatch/J, by
providing a handcrafted SDF syntax definition for Java (J2SE 5.0).

The syntax definitions are from JavaFront 0.9.1. The original
code can be found in the 'original' branch in Git.

You need the StrategoXT tool chain installed in order to compile
the syntax definitions into a parse table. This is only necessary
if you actually change the definitions, since a compiled parse table
is included here.
