2005-04-29 - Java-front 0.7

  This is a major update of Java-front, a package that provides the
  syntax related supported for implementing Java transformation
  systems.

  *Syntax Definition*

  Types that refer to member types of a parameterized (e.g. the type
  =M<O>.N=) class are now supported. This issue was reported by
  Valentin David. Thanks!

  The constructor of the assert statement is now =AssertStm= (was
  =Assert=). This was requested by Valentin David to avoid name
  clashes.

  This release adds support for hexadecimal floating point literals,
  which is a feature that was added to JLS3 without much
  fanfare. Hexadecimal floating point literals have been added to Java
  to allow "precise and predictable specification of particular
  floating-point values".
  
  The parse table =Java-15.tbl= now contains only a single start symbol,
  =CompilationUnit=. This results in better error reporting, for
  obscure reasons. The tool parse-java now uses a different parse
  table with more start-symbols if a different (i.e. not
  =CompilationUnit=) start symbol is specified.

  I've dropped the old 'basic' and 'generic' variants of the Java
  syntax definition. It has been deprecated for some time and doesn't
  seem to be in use anymore.

  *Pretty Printer*

  The Java-front syntax and pretty-printer is now tested with the most
  recent version of GNU Classpath: 0.15. This release contains much
  more Java code, which makes the testing even more thorough.

  A minor bug in the pretty-printing of qualified types has been
  fixed. This issue only showed up after transforming some Java code
  into an AST that would never be produced by the parser: an empty
  qualifier. The pretty-printer now supports these empty qualifiers.

  Internally, the pretty-printer has been restructured to be more
  modular. The module structure is similar to the syntax
  definition. The pretty-printer is now available as a Stratego
  library as well (=java/pp/-=).

  *Stratego Library*

  This release of Java-front generates a module of typematching
  strategies (e.g =is-Expr=) and installs it for use in your Stratego
  programs: =java/typematch/common=.

  *Embedding of Java in Stratego*

  A bug in the meta variable for lists of formal parameters has been
  fixed (reported by Pankaj Risbood, fixed by Rob Vermaas). Also,
  several ambiguity problems have been fixed, some related to
  undesired splitting of identifiers (fixed by Rene de Groot).

  The embedding now supports more verbose meta variables, which
  include a custom name (instead of just allowing a number). Example:
  =bstm_foo= (added by Rene de Groot).

  *Deployment*

  Java-front now uses (and requires) pkg-config. This means that
  explicit configuration with the location of aterm, sdf, and
  strategoxt is no longer required. A plain =./configure= should do
  the job. However, you might need to set your =PKG_CONFIG_PATH= if
  you did not install the dependencies in a standard location.

  =pkg-config= can also be used to compile your Stratego program in a
  more concise way. Java-front declares a pkg-config variable
  =strcflags=, which contains the required include flags. For an
  example, see: http://www.stratego-language.org/Stratego/PkgConfig.

2005-01-14 - Java-front 0.6

  This a minor update of Java-front. In this release, the embedding of
  Java in Stratego has been improved and generalized, to make it
  reusable for embedding in other programming languages.

  Java syntax definition

   * Generalized parameterized types to allow any type as actual type
     argument. The actual limitation to reference type of the current
     Java version should be enforced by semantic checks, since it is a
     semantic limitation.

   * Introduced a general sort (=Modifier=) for all modifiers.

  Java embedding in Stratego

   * =e= is now a meta variable for the left-hand side of an
     assignment.

   * Added quotations for variables, quotations, names, and modifiers.

   * Added disambiguations to support disabling of heuristic filters in
     SGLR. These can be disabled by specifying =HeuristicFilters(Off)=
     in the =.meta= file. See the new of StrategoXT 0.13 for more
     information.

   * Removed the quotation with explicit disambiguation for a list of
     block statement. This is always ambiguous with a single block
     statement, which only shows up if you disable the heuristic
     filters of sglr.

2004-10-04 - Java-front 0.5 

  We are pleased to announce the first official release of java-front.

  Java-front is a package that adds support for Java meta-programming to
  StrategoXT. It contains a handcrafted SDF grammar for Java as it
  appears in J2SE 5.0, Stratego signatures generated from this grammar,
  and a handcrafted pretty printer that supports comment preserving
  transformations.

  The Java syntax definition and pretty-printer are very well
  tested. Java-front is able to parse and pretty-print (round trip is
  checked) all the Java sources in the GNU Classpath and Sun's JDK
  runtime libraries.

  The Stratego-Box grammar has been removed from Java Front. It is
  temporary available as a separate package stratego-box until it will
  be available as a part of GPP.

2002-08-21

  Java Front now comes with a grammar for Generic-Java.  Although
  Generic-Java is a language shared by many proposals for parameterized
  types, this grammar is designed to be compatible with JSR-14: "Adding
  Generics to the Java Programming Language". Of course there is also a
  Stratego-Generic-Java grammar. The pretty-printer has been extended to
  handle generics.

2002-08-20

  The grammar for mixing Stratego and Java has been improved after some
  code generation experiments. Future versions of Java Front might
  include some strategies for code-generation in Stratego.

2002-08-19

  Java Front now comes with a hand-crafted pretty printer This
  pretty-printer has been written in Stratego with concrete syntax for
  the box language of Merijn de Jonge.

  Started including the huge test-suite 'Jacks'.
