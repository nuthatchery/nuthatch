2005-01-14 - Java-front 0.6

  This a minor update of Java-front. In this release, the embedding of
  Java in Stratego has been improved and generalized, to make it
  reusable for embedding in other programming languages.

  Java syntax definition

   * Generalized parameterized types to allow any type as actual type
     argument. The actual limitation to reference type of the current
     Java version should be enforced by semantic checks, since it is a
     semantic limitation.

   * Introduced a general sort (=Modifier=) for all modifiers.

  Java embedding in Stratego

   * =e= is now a meta variable for the left-hand side of an
     assignment.

   * Added quotations for variables, quotations, names, and modifiers.

   * Added disambiguations to support disabling of heuristic filters in
     SGLR. These can be disabled by specifying =HeuristicFilters(Off)=
     in the =.meta= file. See the new of StrategoXT 0.13 for more
     information.

   * Removed the quotation with explicit disambiguation for a list of
     block statement. This is always ambiguous with a single block
     statement, which only shows up if you disable the heuristic
     filters of sglr.

  We are pleased to announce the first official release of java-front.

  Java-front is a package that adds support for Java meta-programming to
  StrategoXT. It contains a handcrafted SDF grammar for Java as it
  appears in J2SE 5.0, Stratego signatures generated from this grammar,
  and a handcrafted pretty printer that supports comment preserving
  transformations.

  The Java syntax definition and pretty-printer are very well
  tested. Java-front is able to parse and pretty-print (round trip is
  checked) all the Java sources in the GNU Classpath and Sun's JDK
  runtime libraries.

  The Stratego-Box grammar has been removed from Java Front. It is
  temporary available as a separate package stratego-box until it will
  be available as a part of GPP.

  Java Front now comes with a grammar for Generic-Java.  Although
  Generic-Java is a language shared by many proposals for parameterized
  types, this grammar is designed to be compatible with JSR-14: "Adding
  Generics to the Java Programming Language". Of course there is also a
  Stratego-Generic-Java grammar. The pretty-printer has been extended to
  handle generics.

  The grammar for mixing Stratego and Java has been improved after some
  code generation experiments. Future versions of Java Front might
  include some strategies for code-generation in Stratego.

  Java Front now comes with a hand-crafted pretty printer This
  pretty-printer has been written in Stratego with concrete syntax for
  the box language of Merijn de Jonge.
