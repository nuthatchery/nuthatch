	* syn/basic/Java-Prefixed.sdf: renamings for some (not all yet)
	Java sorts by prefixing them with Java. This module should be used
	for embedding concrete object syntax in Java.

2004-02-04  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* syn/basic/Java-Comments.sdf: added follow restriction on
	optional layout: LAYOUT?  -/- [\/].[\/]. This restriciton is
	related to the one for /* and solves this problem:
	
	+ * {// aa
	}
	  <ClassBody-CF>
	    {
	    <LAYOUT?-CF>
	    <ClassBodyDec*-CF>
	    <LAYOUT?-CF>
	      <LAYOUT-CF>
	        // aa
	
	    }
	  <ClassBody-CF>
	    {
	    <LAYOUT?-CF>
	      <LAYOUT-CF>
	        // aa
	
	    <ClassBodyDec*-CF>
	    <LAYOUT?-CF>
	    }

	* test/j2sdk: separate directory for j2sdk testsuites.

	* Version to 0.4pre.

	* Bugs to stratego-bugs@cs.uu.nl

2004-01-31  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Follow restriction for /* */ and LAYOUT?. All of GNU Classpath
	java.* is now accepted by the Java grammar of java-front :) .

	* Version to 0.4.

2004-01-31  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Fixed typo causing unicode escape to be rejected.

	* Added final local variabele declarations.

	* Still 3 of 1035 GNU Classpath java.* don't parse.
	
2004-01-31  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Major performance improvements by removing a horrible reject
	construct on 'InputChar'. This appeared to have an amazing bad
	influence on the performance in modules with newline terminated
	single line comments ( // ... )

	* xtc/files2parse-unit-testsuite: generate a parse-unit testsuite
	from a newline separated list of files.

	* test/gnu-classpath/Makefile.am: test the Java grammar by parsing
	the full GNU Classpath. There are still some minor problems and
	parse-unit causes a segmentation fault after parsing about 500
	files. 

2003-08-29  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* Improving the ast of java-front:
	- syn/basic/Java-Identifiers.sdf: Id is now a context-free sort
	 and uses the constructor Id.
	 - ayn/basic/Java-Names.sdf: Name now has a constructor Name.

	 * pp/pp-Java-Names.str, pp/pp-Java.str: using the new ast
	structure.

2003-08-28  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* configure.in: java-front requires stratego-regular from now (who
	doesn't? ;) )

	* Makefile.regular: copied from xml-tools. Should not be modified
	(subversion should support links)

	* syn/basic/Makefile.am: install Java.rtg-nf

2003-02-25  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* pp/Makefile.am: Include sdf/gpp, not sdf/box-tools.

2002-11-23  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Small changes to configure.in to profit from new autotools.

2002-11-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Ad-hoc solution for parentheses around expressions in
	for-loop. A more powerfull solution for priorities must fix this
	later.

2002-11-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added the last missing pretty printing constructs.  Thanks to
	Stefan Reich for mentioning this problem.

2002-11-18  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added priority for array access. I have to figure out if this
	according to the JLS.

2002-09-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Removed the priorities of yesterday. Eelco Visser pointed out
	that because of the interpretation of priorities a while in the
	then branch of an if-else is no longer allowed. A prefer on the
	if-then solves everything.
     
2002-09-19  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added context-free priorities for while, for, and the labeled
	statement. if-then-else > if-then doesn't solve all dangling else
	problems. Now it should work (unit-tests available in de statement
	test-suite).

2002-09-14  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added a production for generic methods in interfaces. I forgot
	this one.

2002-08-29  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Implemented pretty-printing of while.

	* Implemented pretty-printing of (Q)NewInstance with class-bodies
	for Generic Java and classic Java

2002-08-27  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* configure.in improved after some tips of Merijn de Jonge.

	* Added package definition (created by Merijn de Jonge) for the
	Online Package Base. java front and the various required tools can
	now be downloaded as a bundle from the Online Package Base.

2002-08-26  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added a script "parse-java" to parse Java or Generic Java code.

	* Moved all scripts to "scripts"

2002-08-25  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Fixed huge priority bug with method invocation and field access:
	Expr "." Id must have highest priority

2002-08-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added anti quotation for literals to Stratego-Java.sdf

2002-08-22  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Modified pp-Java-Literals to workaround concrete syntax bug in
	Stratego.

	* Implemented pretty-printing for the if construct and throw in
	pp-Java-Statement.

2002-08-21  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Implemented pretty-printing in pp-Generic-Java.

	* Created Generic-Java.sdf, a testsuite and Stratego signature
	generation for Generic-Java.

	* Restructured method invocation

	* Removed distinction TopLevel/Member/Local TypeDecs

2002-08-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added LocalClassDec -> BlockStm

2002-08-19  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Implemented pretty-printer

2002-08-05  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Implemented parse-unit and started a decent testsuite

2002-08-04  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Solved the array creation <-> array access ambiguity with a
	reject.

2002-07-30  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added priorities for binary expressions.

2002-07-29  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Initial version of Java-Expressions module.

2002-07-28  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Work on JLS 2.0: inner classes and primaries.

2002-07-27  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Initial version of the GNU build system powered version of Java
	Front for XT.
