This directory contains the relevant syntax definitions necessary
to parse Stratego term signature modules, such as those generated
by the 'rtg2sig' tool.

The syntax definitions are from Stratego/XT 0.17.

You need the StrategoXT tool chain installed in order to compile
the syntax definitions into a parse table. This is only necessary
if you actually change the definitions, since a compiled parse table
is included here.
