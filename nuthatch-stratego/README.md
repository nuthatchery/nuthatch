## Nuthatch/J+Stratego

This library extends [Nuthatch/J](http://nuthatchery.org/) with support
for [Stratego/XT](http://strategoxt.org/) terms and an interface to
the [JSGLR](http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/JSGLR)  parser table evaluator.

To use, you also need:

1. Nuthatch/J
2. The Stratego term library:
     [`org.spoofax.terms`](https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/spoofax/trunk/spoofax/org.spoofax.terms)
2. JSGLR: 
     [`org.spoofax.jsglr`](https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/spoofax/trunk/spoofax/org.spoofax.jsglr)

## Documentation

Documentation is available at the [Nuthatch website](http://nuthatchery.org/docs/).
