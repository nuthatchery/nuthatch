News for java-front 0.5, released October 04, 2004.

We are proud to announce the first official release of java-front.

Java-front is a package that adds support for Java meta-programming to
StrategoXT. It contains a handcrafted SDF grammar for Java as it
appears in J2SE 5.0, Stratego signatures generated from this grammar,
and a handcrafted pretty printer that supports comment preserving
transformations.

The Java syntax definition and pretty-printed are very well
tested. Java-front is able to parse and pretty-print (round trip is
checked) all the Java sources in the GNU Classpath and Sun's JDK
runtime libraries.
