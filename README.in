IN THIS PACKAGE

You find an SDF syntax definition for Java. I'm still working on this
grammar, so don't expect it to be flawless, but it should do the job
pretty well. This package also includes a Stratego signature generated
from this grammar and a hand-crafted pretty-printer for this signature.

The grammar is trying to be compatible with the Java Language of the
Java 2 SDK v1.4.x. This means that it tries to be compatible with the
Java Language Specifcation 2.0 and that it additionally supports the
assertion facility introduces in 1.4.

For more information:

Java Language Specification 2.0 -
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/

Assert specification -
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/assert-spec.html

In the future you will find in this package:

- Up to date SDF grammar for Java,
- Stratego signature for the abstract syntax of Java,
- desugaring from the generated signature to this abstract syntax,
- sugaring from the abstract syntax signature to the generated grammar.

INSTALLATION

To install this program first install the StrategoXT package of program
transformation tools that can be found at
  
  http://www.stratego-language.org/

The StrategoXT package must be installed with concrete syntax support.
You will also need the Stratego-box package. This package is available at

  http://www.mbravenboer.org/software/stratego-box/

then configure java-front by

  ./configure --prefix=${prefix} \
              --with-sdf=${sdf-prefix}
              --with-stratego-xt=${stratego-prefix}

which assumes that StrategoXT is installed at ${stratego-prefix}, 
SDF2 (which is required for StrategoXT) is installed at ${sdf-prefix},
and declares that the programs in this package should be installed
at ${prefix}. 

Make the components of java-front by invoking
  
  gmake

and install them by means of

  gmake install
