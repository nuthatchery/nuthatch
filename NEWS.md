   * Reorganised repository so that all sub-projects are merged into a single repository. Done by pulling the other repositories into the main one and moving them into subdirectories with "git mv", so all history is still available, and hashes are unchanged.

   * Created new branch [develop](../tree/develop), where a number of breaking changes will take place (e.g., starting to require Java 8)
