## Nuthatch/J

[Nuthatch/J](http://nuthatchery.org/) is a library for software
transformation and analysis, based on tree walking.

Transformations are described as walks that proceed in 
programmer-defined steps. Each step may which may observe
join points of a traversal, and affect state associated with
the walk and also rewrite the walked tree. Each step ends by
walking to a different node in the tree, following the
tree branches.

This package contains the core Nuthatch/J library. You may also
want to interface with either Stratego/XT or Rascal:

1. [Nuthatch/J+Stratego](https://github.com/nuthatchery/nuthatch-stratego)
2. [Nuthatch/J+Rascal](https://github.com/nuthatchery/nuthatch-rascal)

## Documentation

Documentation is available at the [Nuthatch website](http://nuthatchery.org/docs/).
