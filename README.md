## Nuthatch/J+JavaFront

This project contains the relevant syntax definitions for the
[JavaFront](http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/JavaFront) parser originally
developed for [Stratego](http://strategoxt.org/).

JavaFront adds support for Java program transformation to Nuthatch/J, by
providing a handcrafted SDF syntax definition for Java (J2SE 5.0).

The syntax definitions are from JavaFront 0.9.1. The original
code can be found in the ['original' branch in Git](https://github.com/nuthatchery/nuthatch-javafront/tree/original).

You need the [StrategoXT tool chain](http://strategoxt.org/) installed in order to compile
the syntax definitions into a parse table. This is only necessary
if you actually change the definitions, since a compiled parse table
is included here.

To use, you also need:

1. Nuthatch/J, and Nuthatch/J+Stratego
2. The Stratego term library:
     [`org.spoofax.terms`](https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/spoofax/trunk/spoofax/org.spoofax.terms)
2. JSGLR: 
     [`org.spoofax.jsglr`](https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/spoofax/trunk/spoofax/org.spoofax.jsglr)
