## Nuthatch/J

[Nuthatch/J](http://nuthatchery.org/) is a library for software
transformation and analysis, based on tree walking.

Transformations are described as walks that proceed in 
programmer-defined steps. Each step may which may observe
join points of a traversal, and affect state associated with
the walk and also rewrite the walked tree. Each step ends by
walking to a different node in the tree, following the
tree branches.

This repository contains the core Nuthatch/J library, and interfaces
towards other systems:

1. [Nuthatch/J+Stratego](nuthatch-stratego/)
2. [Nuthatch/J+JavaFront](nuthatch-javafront/)
2. [Nuthatch/J+Rascal](nuthatch-rascal/)

## Documentation

Documentation is available at the [Nuthatch website](http://nuthatchery.org/docs/).

## Warning: Experimental Software!

Nuthatch/J is currently highly experimental, and the API is changing all the time.
